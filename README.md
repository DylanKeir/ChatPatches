# Where's My Chat History

This mod does a few things:
- Increases the maximum amount of chat based on allocated RAM (but minimally it goes from 100 -> 1024 max messages)
- Adds a timestamp in front of all messages, formatted like [HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND] in pink text, with a tooltip that renders a complete date down to the millisecond
- Keeps chat history and previously sent messages across ALL world/servers (but automatically resets on game exit)

## Setup

I don't know, just download the code maybe? Do whatever you'd normally do? I've been working on this for like 3 weeks and I'm exhausted so sorry to be that guy but just figure it out please.
Prebuilt .JAR files can be found in **build/libs**.
