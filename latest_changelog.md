## Changes with this version
- Another backport for 1.19.2
- Contains the ChatPatches rebrand (also changes config file used from `chatpatches.json` to `chatpatches.json`, if you have a config file from an older version,
  you'll need to rename it)
- Also adds the `chatWidth` option to allow for larger than vanilla chat width
