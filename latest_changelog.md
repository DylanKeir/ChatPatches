### Changes with this version
- Fixed a couple YACL issues
- Fixed [#55](https://www.github.com/mrbuilder1961/WheresMyChatHistory/issues/55)
- Fixed weird ordering of config values in the GitHub table and in the config file
- Renamed `boundaryStr` and `counterStr` to `boundaryFormat` and `counterFormat`
- `boundaryFormat`'s tooltip now directly states that `\n` can be used, and the default value of `nameFormat` is now `<$>` like vanilla ([#57](https://www.github.com/mrbuilder1961/WheresMyChatHistory/issues/57))
- Replaced the final two instances of ClothConfig in the project with YACL

### Notes
This is the last update that will be released **for 1.19.3** until I have backported this to [other Minecraft versions](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/WheresMyChatHistory/issues/47).
(unless of course there is some big issue that needs to be fixed, or I have forgotten about)
