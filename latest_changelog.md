## Changes with this version
- Backported everything from after [July 20, 2022](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches/commit/5270883f5a9e5c53f77cea262701a701af4e8cc4), to all 1.18 
  versions
- Enormous file diff [here](https://github.com/mrbuilder1961/ChatPatches/compare/5270883...6609f93).
- Also applies fixes from the 192.2.1/193.2.3 versions
### Notice
I did not realize before switching config libraries that YetAnotherConfigLib doesn't backport, so it seems like these older versions will continue to use Cloth 
Config.
